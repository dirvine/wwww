Notes regarding licensing glib code.
====================================

Files: src/core/util/unicode/*

Some portions of glib code have been used in Lucene++, a project
spawned from CLucene, with special permission from the author(s).
This is the email exchange that took place in 2006 between
Ben van Klinken, Owen Taylor and Tom Tromey:

I'd have to know more specifically what particular portions of
the GLib code are involved; can you be more specific about
particular functions and code portions? while I did much of the work,
there have been additions made later on by other people, and a good
portion of the code derives originally from libunicode by
Tom Tromey. (Cc'ed)

For the portions that are actually my code I don't have any
objection to them also being licensed under the Apache license ...
it's pretty much straightforward implementations of algorithms from
the Unicode standard, and other implementations are widely available in
many forms.

Regards,
Owen

I was wondering ... if other people made substantial contributions
after this code was written, wouldn't they also be copyright holders?
You'd have to use the cvs history to see this.

It is fine by me.
