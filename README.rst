It can be done, just don't know if it will be me that can do it. 

Required packages (to build for and test on arm hardfloat and softfloat, linux 32 & 64bit, mingw 32 & 64 bit)

    sudo apt-get install  mingw32 mingw-w64 g++-mingw-w64 gcc-mingw-w64 gdb-mingw-w64-target mingw32-binutils binutils-mingw-w64 wine qemu qemu-system-arm qemu-system-x86 qemu-system qtemu qemu-utils cmake multiarch-support
